## Usage
Development Mode
To start the development server and launch your application, run the following command:

npm start

This command will compile your HTML files in the src directory and open the application in your default browser. Any changes you make to the source files will trigger an automatic rebuild and live reload of the page.

## Production Build
When you're ready to build your application for production, run the following command:

npm run build

This will generate a optimized and minified version of your application in the dist directory. The production build is suitable for deployment to a web server or hosting platform.
